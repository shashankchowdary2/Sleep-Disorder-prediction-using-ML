ðŸ§  Project Title:
Sleep Disorder Prediction Using Machine Learning

ðŸ“Œ Description:

Developed a machine learning-based system to predict sleep disorders such as insomnia and apnea using real-time user health data. Performed extensive preprocessing, EDA, and feature engineering on medical datasets. Trained and compared classification models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, QDA, and Logistic Regression â€” achieving up to 95% accuracy with Random Forest. Integrated the best-performing model into a Flask web application for real-time predictions. The interface provided users with instant results, visualizations, and preventive recommendations, improving accessibility and health awareness.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
Languages/Tools: Python, Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, REST API

Techniques: EDA, Label Encoding, Standard Scaler, Feature Selection, Model Evaluation (Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC AUC)
